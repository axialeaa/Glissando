![**Glissando**'s note block interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323d591e-ef6c-4451-8a90-8fb8959341a9)

**Glissando** is a [Fabric][fabric] mod that attempts to fix what I personally believe to be some severe issues when it comes to the way note blocks work, allowing music-making to be more comfortable and satisfying than ever before! **Glissando**'s highly-customizable <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> fits right into this mod's goal: *as few clicks as possible*.

Check out [the wiki][wiki] for a more in-depth overview of **Glissando**'s features!

> [!NOTE]
> **Glissando** is currently under some major construction! I will update it when I can, but it may not be soon. I'm not lying when I say that more than half the codebase is being totally reworked xD

<h2 align=center>📝 Getting Started 📝</h2>

**Glissando**'s production operates on [Stonecutter][stonecutter], allowing for easy multi-version scheming. Every release will be available for all the same game versions as the latest release of [YetAnotherConfigLib][yacl], the API used to build **Glissando**'s configuration screen.

- Make sure you're running a Fabric instance of the game. If you're playing from the vanilla launcher, follow the [Fabric installation guide][fabric-guide]. If you're playing from a third-party launcher like [Prism][prism], you'll need to follow their own instructions which you can often find on their respective websites. For example, [here][prism-guide] is Prism's guide to downloading mods.
- If you're not using a third-party launcher with in-built mod installation, you'll need to download the latest version of **Glissando** for your game version from the [GitHub releases][github-releases] page or on [Modrinth][modrinth-versions]. Drag the `.jar` file into your mods folder and launch the game!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Glissando** requires both [Fabric API][fabric-api] and [YetAnotherConfigLib][yacl]. Without them, the game will fail to start!

<h2 align=center>🛠️ Configuration 🛠️</h2>

**Glissando** prides itself on its extensive feature customizability, which is why there is a button to bring up the menu right inside the interface itself! It looks like this, iconized by a tiny keyboard with a gear in the corner:

</p>

Alternatively, you can access the configuration screen via [Mod Menu][modmenu] directly, as shown below.

> [!NOTE]
> There is an option to disable the config button if you have Mod Menu installed, but it won't be available to you if you don't. Otherwise you won't be able to access the configuration screen at all!

> [!TIP]
> You can preview any graphical changes you may have made to the GUI by clicking the "Preview GUI" button at the top of the Visuals tab!

<h2 align=center>🤗 Support Me! 🤗</h2>

Modding takes a lot of work, so if you're enjoying what I'm doing and wish to show your gratitude, you *have the option* to give me a tip over on Ko-fi. It's entirely up to you. I would appreciate it massively!
