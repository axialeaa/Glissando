I made a mistake...

## ➕ Additions
Added 🇪🇸 spanish translations. Thanks, [FlatKat](https://github.com/Flatkat)!

## 🐛 Fixes
- The skeleton instrument should now be added to the `top` and `untunable` instrument tags.

## 🐜 Fixes since 1.2.1 (for pre-1.20.6)
- Top and untunable instruments should now correctly be added to their respective tags. My datagen failed and I'm annoyed about it.
